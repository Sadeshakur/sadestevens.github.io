<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
  I'm an enthusiastic web developer, hailing right out of General Assembly's web development immersive program.

    Although I had been interested in web development for a while, I never fully imagined myself as a developer. Once I got to General Assembly, my eyes widened as my brain expanded. Learning how to build digital products, revealed the possibilities for creativity, freedom and innovation that I had always been seeking. Since then I've been eager to supplement my skills with practice, I'm currently working on a few open source projects, and learning swift for mobile app development. I am looking to work for a company with a great team dynamic and a creative work-flow!
